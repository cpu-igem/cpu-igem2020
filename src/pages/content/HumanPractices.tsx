    <h1>Integrated Human Practices</h1>
    <H2>Overview</H2>
    <p>The inspiration for our project is rooted in social phenomena and social drinking culture. We must understand the feasibility, potential and value of our project in the interaction with various roles in society. We must also consider how to successfully apply our projects to society. To this end, we conducted literature research, public interviews and doctor interviews in the early stage, and visited pharmacies to understand the current framework and current needs of alcoholic liver disease treatment. We understand the professor's opinion to improve our project. It cannot be ignored that alcoholic liver injury and drinking habits are inseparable from the social drinking culture. Therefore, we communicated with psychologists and experts from the Alcoholics Anonymous. We hope to combine our adjuvant therapy with psychology. The combination of treatment can achieve the effect of jointly reducing dependence on alcohol, reducing alcohol consumption, maintaining a low-risk drinking pattern or gradual abstinence to avoid severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In order to understand the commercial feasibility of our project, we conducted detailed research and interacted with pharmaceutical companies to get their feedback. Our human practices have been well integrated throughout the project, which greatly broadened our vision on the subject of alcoholic liver injury, and more importantly, improved our project by considering the opinions of different stakeholders.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Weihua Chu has done excellent work in the research of bacterial quorum sensing. After further literature research, we learned that Enterococcus faecalis that enters the liver is the main negative impact. So we decided to take more direct measures, that is, to directly target and kill Enterococcus faecalis. We seek the opinion of Dr. Chu Weihua on this.</p>

                    <p>We comprehensively consider the construction of the amplification system plasmid. The increase in alcohol concentration in the intestine will make the ethanol promoter start more efficient, and will enable the engineered bacteria to express a larger amount of IL-22. The adjustment of RBS can affect the expression of T7RNAP, which in turn affects the expression of IL-22. Antisense RNA will bind to mRNA and inhibit translation, which will decrease the expression of IL-22. When constructing the plasmid, we qualitatively considered the influence of each part. It is obvious that there are redundant parts in the components of the amplification system. Therefore, we plan to quantify the above three components through modeling. According to the target expression of IL-22, we delete redundant components.</p>
